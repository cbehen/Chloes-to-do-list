# to-do-list
Makes a grocery list

To start, run the program. You will be prompted with a list of options. Input the number that corresponds to the choice you want. 
If you just wanted to print the list, you don't need to do anything. If you wanted to edit the list, type in what item you want to add/delete. 
At the end you will be prompted to run the program again or quit. Type in either "yes" to run again or "no" to quit the program.
